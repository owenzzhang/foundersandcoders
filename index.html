              I'm on a mission to become a full stack developer. Based in
              Bristol, I've been delving into coding because I find it
              incredibly exciting and rewarding. <br /><br />
              As a freelancer, I've had the opportunity to work on various
              projects, specializing in building websites using CRM systems.
              <br /><br />
              My ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer, and I'm
              actively working towards that. I'm fascinated by the idea of
              mastering both the frontend and backend aspects of web
              development, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in
              this field.
